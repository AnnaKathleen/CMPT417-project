# CMPT417-project

### Usage
replace < algorithm >, with the algorithm you want to run, from the avaliable list of algorithms:
BFS, DFS, Astar, DFID, WAST, ...
replace the # in <#Puzzle>, with the size of the puzzle you want to run, from the avaliable list of puzzle sizes:
8-Puzzle, 15-Puzzle,...
```
python3 <algorithm>.py <#Puzzle>
```

the following are some instances that work for our algorithms 
# startState = [5, 1, 0, 3, 7, 6, 4, 8, 2] 
# startState = [2, 1, 5, 6, 4, 8, 3, 7, 0]
# startState = [3, 2, 5, 7, 0, 4, 8, 6, 1]
# startState = [6, 7, 8, 4, 1, 0, 5, 2, 3]
# startState = [0, 5, 4, 3, 1, 8, 2, 6, 7]
# startState = [5, 4, 2, 0, 6, 1, 7, 8, 3]
# StartState = [7, 1, 2, 6, 0, 4, 8, 3, 5]
